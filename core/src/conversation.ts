// A conversation by voice: the listener and the speaker, each on or off on
// its own, and ending turns automatically as a switch of its own. Both on is
// a conversation, the speaker alone read aloud, the listener alone
// dictation. What the person says gathers into a draft, which goes out as
// one turn: at a segment's end if turns end automatically, else when the
// person sends it.
// Words take the floor, pausing the speaker, and a turn they end in drops
// what was not heard of the agents' messages: any voice's words while no
// voice is named, only a named voice's once any is. The voice the speaker
// plays is its own, heard back as echo, which never takes the floor and is
// never sent. While the speaker plays, words take the floor only once their
// voice is known, and only a few words or a word to stop, so that the speaker
// reads on over a "mhm". Few words that only signal listening, a
// backchannel, are no turn and are not sent; other few words are. Words that
// didn't count, as its echo, too quiet or such a backchannel while it
// played, show for a while, to send. The listener only perceives, and this
// decides. What happens is heard as short cues, so that voice seems
// responsive while nothing is said.
// Ending turns only decides whether a turn goes out by itself: the listener
// only ever listens or stops, and with turns ended by hand what is said
// gathers in the draft until the person sends it.
// Its edges are the person's audio in, the audio to play out, the agents'
// messages in, and the person's turns out: the host carries them, and plugs
// in the tier, which transcribes and speaks.
